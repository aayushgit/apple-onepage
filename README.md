Steps:
1.Make sure you have a local server installed in your computer (WAMP,XAMPP or LAMP)
2.Run the WAMPP/XAMPP or LAMP client
3.Clone the repository in your local machine's folder (i.e htdocs if XAMPP or www/ if WAMP)
4.Find a sql file named apple.sql which is the sql file that you will need to import in your database (phpmyadmin in this context)
5.Run the files from the server's path
6.Make changes as you like and keep me posted.
Cheers!
